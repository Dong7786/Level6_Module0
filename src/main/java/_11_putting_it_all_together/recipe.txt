Now we will look at how to use unit testing and mocking to test a class that utilizes an API.
Connecting to an API is a prime example of when we would want to use mocking, as we do not want to rely
on the class making the request, or the service itself when we write unit tests.
Examine IntroToApisTest in the main.java.test._01_intro_to_APIs package, and ask if you have any questions.
Next, you will apply everything we have discussed to test a class utilizing an API yourself.
